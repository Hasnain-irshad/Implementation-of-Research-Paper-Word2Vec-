# Implementation-of-Research-Paper-Word2Vec-

This project is an **implementation of the Word2Vec model (Skip-Gram + CBOW)** from scratch, inspired by the original paper:

**Efficient Estimation of Word Representations in Vector Space (Mikolov et al., 2013)**

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Preprocessing of raw text
- Build Skip-Gram and CBOW datasets
- Train Word2Vec with negative sampling
- Visualize embeddings with t-SNE
- Save and load trained embeddings
